Project: Mobile Controlled Web Powerpoint System


IMPORTANT NOTICE: [August 13th 2012]

1. This was my first web project and first time ever using javascript and php in a non-trivial manner.

2. The JavaScript in this project is mind-boggling INEFFECIENT and has to be updated!!!!
The goal of this project was to create something that functioned due to the
time constraint of the project itself and the requirements that were determined.
